# Coral-health-classification

Coral reefs, often called the “rainforests of the sea,” cover less than 1% of the ocean floor yet support around 25% of marine life. They are vital for maintaining biodiversity, providing food and income to coastal communities, serving as a source of bioactive compounds for medicine, and contributing significantly to global tourism. Despite their ecological and economic importance, reefs are highly vulnerable to rising sea temperatures, coral bleaching, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development.

Conventional monitoring methods depend on divers conducting manual surveys, which are costly, time-consuming, and limited in scope. These methods also suffer from subjectivity and human error, making it difficult to capture large-scale or real-time reef changes.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a deep learning–based coral monitoring system that applies image processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and semantic segmentation techniques to analyze underwater images and videos. The model can accurately classify coral species, detect bleaching, and identify diseases, providing a faster, more scalable, and objective alternative to manual inspections. Extensive experimentation demonstrated its ability to process large datasets efficiently, thereby enabling more reliable and consistent reef health assessments.

While the integration of this model with drones, underwater vehicles, or edge devices remains a future direction, the current model establishes a strong foundation for automated reef monitoring. By improving accuracy, reducing costs, and enabling continuous assessment, this work has the potential to significantly enhance conservation strategies and support timely decision-making for protecting fragile coral ecosystems.
